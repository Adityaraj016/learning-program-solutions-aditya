# 📈 Financial Forecasting – Cognizant Digital Nurture

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Build a financial forecasting tool that calculates future values using a recursive algorithm, based on an initial value and a growth rate.

---

## 🔁 What is Recursion?
Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It can simplify problems like calculating compound growth over years.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented
- Recursive method to calculate future value over `n` years
- Optimized version using memoization (caching)
- Base parameters: 
  - Initial value: 1000
  - Growth rate: 5%
  - Years: 5

---

## ⏱ Time Complexity

### Recursive Version
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n) stack frames (can be inefficient for large `n`)

### Optimized (Memoized) Version
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n) memo dictionary + stack
